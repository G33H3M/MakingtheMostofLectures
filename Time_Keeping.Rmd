# Tutorial
### Organising Your Time Around Your Lectures

The aim of this section is to get you to think about time management: scheduling, planning, and reviewing your time around lectures. We encourage you to set aside blocks of time dedicated to revising lecture content and to plan ahead to make sure you can attend your lectures live. Having a think about how your entire semester will look should help you to plan your week and set realistic goals.

For many students, being at university is an exciting time of change and new opportunities. You might find that learning at university is somewhat different from your experience of previous educational establishments, and learning in the lecture hall may be one of those differences. For many, being taught in lectures is something that you first experience at university. Your timetable will probably be sparser than when you were at school or college, and so you will have to undertake a lot more _independent_ studying. The amount of independent study required, is also likely increase as you progress to the later years of your degree.

When devising a timetable, think about where you will be in each time block: the lecture hall, the library, the gym, etc. Whilst good study habits involve working where you won't be too disturbed, this will look different for everyone. Indeed, it is important to reflect on what works for you: are you better sticking to a strict timetable, or does flexibility to work when you feel productive suit you better? Certain environments will help or hinder your studying (alone vs group; silent vs noisy). Make sure you timetable some time at the end of your week to review how your timetable is working for you so you can make changes for the following week. When you get to the next section and you learn about SMART goals, you will want to timetable some time to review your goals too. 

Research has shown that students who actively organise their workloads and update their timetables and organisational styles to suit the demands of their course tend to outperform students who don't engage in this _metagcognitive_ learning behaviour (thinking _explicity_ about one's own learning).  For more information on reflecting on your progress, see the Going Forward section.

The following exercises should help you to organise your time to keep on top of your lecture attendance and study timetable. After completing the exercises, you might want to transfer what you have learned onto a timetable app on your phone for convenience (see additional resources).

Keep in mind that, whilst organising your semester is best done at the start of the semester, the skills that you learn here can be implemented at any point in the semester. It is never too late to get started; wherever you are in the semester, put into practise what you learn on this course.

### Planner Examples

In this folder you will find a planner, which you can customise for each week of the semester, and a planner that will detail your key deadlines throughout the semester (see your courses' handbooks for the key deadlines). Using these planners together will give you an overview of your semester and will allow you to effectively plan your weekly workload to ensure you meet your deadlines. A good idea is to timetable a few slots throughout your week where you can revisit specific parts of your lectures to consolidate your learning. Of course, if for some reason you have to miss a lecture, then you can use this slot to catchup on a missed lecture. Whilst attending a live lecture is most effective, it is preferable to catch up with a lecture recording than not at all. Keep on top of your workload (around your weekly lectures) by planning ahead.
