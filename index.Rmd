# **Making the Most of Lectures**

Welcome to Making the Most of Lectures: an interactive course that has been designed to help you use lectures and lecture recordings to enhance your learning. Drawing on evidence-based techniques, this non-credit course will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can integrate lectures and lecture recordings (if available) into your studying.

Whilst it is not necessary to work through the materials sequentially, starting with the first section and working your way to the final section may be the most rewarding approach. The materials have been organised in this order to allow you to build on the skills you learned in previous sections. 

Although completing the entire course at the start of the semester is preferable, you can implement the information and skills you learn in the course at any time. If it is near exams, then goal setting and revising your lectures might be a good place to start.

The skills you will learn here have been chosen because they work well together; but this course is in no way exclusive nor exhaustive. We encourage you to reflect on who you are as student, using what you learn here as a springboard into exploring effective study strategies and the use of lectures (and recordings) in more depth.
