# Reflection

### Bonus Tutorial: Reflecting on Your Goals

#### What is reflection?

* A process in which learners monitor and regulate their own learning progress independently. By reflecting on how you have implemented the skills that you have learned in this course, not only will you further develop those skills, but you will learn to evaluate how effective they are for you. In so doing, you will avoid continuing with habits that don't work for you by implementing better ones.  

#### Why reflect?

* You will learn about your individual learning styles and individual values as a student and will be more able to tailor your goals and strategies to your needs and skills.
* It will help you work against the uncritical use of ineffective learning strategies.
* You will develop your problem-solving skills as you generate solutions to any challenges you have faced.
* You will be more productive as your streamline your learning.
* You are learning the key skill of critical thinking, which you will use frequently during your time at university.

#### How does this look? 

Ideally throughout your week (or at the end of the week), you will review how your timetable, goals, notetaking, and revision are working for you. If you have set measurable goals, you can start your reflection by asking if you have successfully completed these goals. If the answer is yes, then ask yourself why you managed them: 

* Which factors facilitated your completion of the goals?
* Which environments were most conducive to your success (for example library or home)?
* Could you implement what helped you in one goal to complete another future goal?

If the answer is no, then ask yourself:

* How were you stopped from reaching your goal?
* How will you avoid making the same mistakes in the week to come?
* Which resources can you get a hold of to help you improve your timetable, goals, and revision?
* Is there anyone that you could ask for some advice? 

#### Key Questions to Ask

1. What have I achieved this week and how?
2. What were the factors that helped me to be successful?
3. What are my strengths as an individual that helped me meet my goals?
4. What didn't work so well for me that I can change easily for next week?

#### Next Steps

Have a look at the documents in the folder below this tutorial. You will see an example of a reflection grid; use this example alongside the blank template when you come to reflect on how well the skills you have learned in this course are working for you in real-life practice. Remember that they key to reflection is in honestly identifying what is working for you; what is not working for you; what you can do to maximise your success; and then implementing those changes. 

### Bonus Task: Reflection Grid and Example

Have a look at the reflective log example for some ideas on effective reflection. You should be reflecting on your weekly progress at regular intervals and setting time to collate your self-feedback in order to make ammendments for your week ahead.

# Overcoming Procrastination

If you have identified procrastination as a challenge in your personal reflection, have a look at this evidence-based technique to help you overcome it.

### The Pomodoro Technique

#### What is it?

* Watch this short animation to get a grip on what the pomodoro (Italian for _tomato_... all will be revealed) technique is.

</center>

#### How can I use it?

* With your [timetable](https://grahamreidpsychology.github.io/MakingtheMostofLectures/Time_Keeping.html) and [**SMART** goals](https://grahamreidpsychology.github.io/MakingtheMostofLectures/Goal_Setting.html) for each course at hand, break down your tasks into small chunks of 25 minutes + 5 minutes break. You would have two pomodoro chunks per hour on your timetable. 
* Say you have a particular lecture for which you want to create flashcards. Firstly, decide on where and when you want to work on this task (based on your reflection). Your **SMART** goal details that you want to create 15 flashcards for this lecture based on 5 ILOs. You need to change the ILOs into questions and then you need to use your [notes](https://grahamreidpsychology.github.io/MakingtheMostofLectures/Note_Taking.html) to find the answers to the questions. Of course, you would try to answer the questions before looking at your lecture notes ([active recall](https://grahamreidpsychology.github.io/MakingtheMostofLectures/Additional_Resources.html#evidence-based_learning_and_study_strategies)). For 25 minutes, you work on making flashcards. You are able to make 5 amazing flashcards in this time period. You would need about 3 pomodoro chunks to complete this task.
* Set a timer on your phone (or use the link below if you are really committed and don't want to look at your phone at all) and work for 25 minutes without any distractions. After the 25 minutes, take note of your progress (for [reflection](https://grahamreidpsychology.github.io/MakingtheMostofLectures/Going_Forward.html#reflection)) and have a 5 minutes break. 
* Repeat this twice within your hour chunk on the timetable. However, you might find that working in pomodoro chunks is more effective that sticking to hour blocks on the timetable. In this case, you could fill you timetable with tasks to be done each day (ignoring time blocks) and work your way through them in pomodoro chunks.
* As you implement these skills, it will become apparent what works well for you and what doesn't. When you have identified this, update your planner and skills accordingly.
